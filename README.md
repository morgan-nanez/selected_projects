# Overview

This is private repo that contains school projects I either did alone from scratch or contributed heavily. Each project is within  it's respective folder.

## Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii photo collection [cs194_proj1]

The goal of the project is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and apply image processing techniques to automatically produce a color image. The basic method is to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image.
